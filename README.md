The Undergraduate Admission Prediction System uses the Random Forest Regression algorithm to predict applicants' chances of being admitted to college based on their overall grades and ranks. The official Tamil Nadu Engineering Admissions (TNEA) website provided the training dataset, guaranteeing its dependability and pertinence. By directing prospective students to universities where they have the best chance of being admitted based on their academic standing, the system seeks to give them insightful information. The model gains the ability to produce correct predictions by understanding patterns and relationships within the dataset through the application of machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest Regression. Through the practical use of data science in the field of education, this project helps educational institutions and students make well-informed decisions.
